This was our Fundamentals of Software Engineering project in which we developed a demo Voting Web Application for US Elections.

## Tech Stack
Database – MySQL

Frontend – HTML, CSS

Backend – JavaScript, Node.js

## Voters and Candidates
This includes registering as a voter or candidate, voter identitiy verification, login and dashboards. 

## Admin
It also includes an admin panel for setting up elections and voting booth setup in different cities and counties. 
The admin is also responsible for approving the voters before they can vote, or if they need to change their details it requires admin's approval.
Admin can create, view and stop the elections.
